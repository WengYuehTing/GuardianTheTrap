## Collaboration
The game was in close collaboration with students of Department of Digital Media Design, Yuntech. Our team contained five people. All of the elements in this game, including code, models, animations, materials, and audio files, were also made by ourselves.

## Note
This repository contains only blueprint scripts and c++ files I made, excluding the materials, textures, models and so on. It is supposed to have many compiler errors about assets missing.
