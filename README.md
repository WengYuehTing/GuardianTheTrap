## Collaboration
This game was collaborated with students in Department of Digital Media Design, Yuntech. All of the artistic elements including models, animations, materials, and audios were also made by ourselves. 

## Note
This repository excluded the materials, textures, models, animations, and audio files, containing only blueprint scripts and c++ files I made,  so it supposed to have a lot of complier errors about assets missing.
